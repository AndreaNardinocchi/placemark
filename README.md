# SETU | Full Stack Web Development Assignment 1

This is a simple project for learning full stack web development based upon a template called 'playtime' created by Eamonn de Leastar (Lecturer at SETU, Waterford, Ireland).

This is a node.js, hapi.js, and TDD (Test Driven Development) based project, designed to work well with the Glitch development environment as well. It includes basic hapi setup, handlebars templating, routing, + lowdb database, Joi validation, Restful and openAPI, and JWT API authentication.

# PlaceMark App

This website is about implementing a Points of Interest app using:

- node.js
- hapi,js
- Joi Schema validation
- Handlebars
- lowdb database
- [Mongo DB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database
- json database
- RestFul API implementations
- openAPI
- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)
- [Render](https://render.com/)

whose data can be manually submitted by the user, and fed into the app, and stored into a Mongo database .

# What this project does

Its purpose is simply to create and show placemarks or [points of interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_interest) or destinations to the user, which, as mentioned earlier, are fed into the app by the user itself. In a nutshell, the user creates their own points of interest via a [Bulma form](https://bulma.io/documentation/form/). However, these placemarks will be 'categorized', namely created on the hill of categories selected by the user, since categories precede placemarks in the app hierarchy (user -> categories -> placemarks).
Therefore, the user will first sign-up or log-in, then, they will create a category (only 4 categories are allowed per user), and, once the category is created, relevant placemarks will be added for each category (Ex. category 'Restaurants' -> placemark 'A Casa do Porco, São Paulo').

In a nutshell, the user will have a dashboard with a list of categories they have added, and each of them will link out to a list of their placemarks. Additionaly, each placemark will link out to a simple dedicated and individual placemark landing page.

# Why the project is useful

The project is useful for those users that would like to note down those destinations or, better said, those points of interest/placemarks/locations, and so on and so forth, that they would like to visit. Nevertheless, the user will also be able to mark down whether a placemark has eventually been visited (like adding a check to a dashboard line). As I will explain further down this document, 'selecting' whether a placemark has been visited or not is actually a mandatory field in a placemark form, and its info is relevants for 'analytical purposes'.

Apart from all of the above, the very main purpose of the project was for the writer to be exposed to the use of Bulma components, Javascript, node.js, hapi.js, handlebars, and all of the frameworks, modules, platforms above mentioned, when developing a MVC [Model View Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) app.

The ultimate idea here would have also been to expand the website insofar that it would have included a Google map indicating the geolocation of each placemark right inside each placemark card (the map currently in the placemark card is just a placeholder).

Technical challenges at this stage of my study are not always easy to overcome. Nevertheless, I count on the lectures to come to be able to fill my knowledge gaps, and being able to ultimately revisit and enhance the app soon.

# How users can get started with the project

## Home page

As a user opens up the **PlaceMark** app, they will see a sticky nav bar on the top for an easy navigation throughout the website.

### Navigation bars

The Navbar shows all items that the user needs for a comfortable and friendly navigation.
The **welcome-menu.hbs** partial is the one that the user will see in the 'log out' state (it also features the PlaceMark logo, which is clickable, and links to the Homepage **main.hbs**.):

![alt text](image.png)

The **menu.hbs**, instead, is what the user will see in their loggedin state, which contains more items (it also features the logo, which is clickable, and links to the Dashboard view **dashboard.hbs**.):

![alt text](image-1.png)

Last, but not least, the navbar is responsive and mobile-friendly:

I also studied some examples online such as https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bulma-navbar/.

### Card Image Grid on the main.hbs page

As the user scrolls down, they will bump into a paragraph inviting the user to log in or sign up, right above a grid made of Bulma card images

![alt text](image-4.png)

This is just a nice, easy on the eye grid to get the user familiarized with the categories they will use.

### Footer

At the bottom of the page, there is a footer (**footer.hbs** partial), with a 2 column layout.
While the first column shows an Irish address, the column on the right shows nav items/links.
Additionally, there is an underfooter with the 'PlaceMark' clickable logo to boost brand awareness, and a string with the developer Linkedin link.

## Lifestyle page

(\*This page is part of a previous assignment for web-dev 1)

This page is basically a blog embedded into the website and users can supposedly use the search bar on the top to search for a tourist destination (I found it interesting to combine the placemark subject with the tourist one).
It shows a variegated layout (**lifestyle-view.hbs**).

## News page

(\*This page is part of a previous assignment web-dev 1)

This page is supposed to be a 'news' page to get travelers up to speed with the latest news about tourist destinations (**news-view.hbs**).

## About page

This is just a simple and plain page with a centered copy (header and paraghraph, **about-view.hbs**) contained in a 'box':

## Log in page

The 'Log in' page is a 2 column layout with a Bulma form on the left column and the PlaceMark logo on the right (**login-view**):

![alt text](image-6.png)

It is routed as per the below line of code in **web-routes.js**

```
 { method: "GET", path: "/login", config: accountsController.showLogin },
```

and its view is rendered by the **accounts-controller.js**

```
  showLogin: {
    auth: false,
    handler: function (request, h) {
      return h.view("login-view", { title: "Login to Placemark" });
    },
  },
  login: {
    auth: false,
    validate: {
      payload: UserCredentialsSpec,
      options: { abortEarly: false },
      failAction: function (request, h, error) {
        return h.view("login-view", { title: "Login error", errors: error.details }).takeover().code(400);
      },
    },
    handler: async function (request, h) {
      const { email, password } = request.payload;
      const user = await db.userStore.getUserByEmail(email);
      if (!user || user.password !== password) {
        return h.redirect("/");
      }
      // We set the cookie and istall the object 'user', passing the '._id' of the user
      request.cookieAuth.set({ id: user._id });
      return h.redirect("/dashboard");
    },
```

Once the user prompts the log in action, their data will be verified by the above 'handler' which will check email and password. The below function, instead, will validate whether the user exists by checking the 'payload' of the variable 'UserCredentialsSpec' (Joi schema).

```
 /**
   * The function has access to a session object - which will have the users ID.
   * We use this ID to locate the user object from the store and, if found,
   * return this object: { isValid: true, credentials: user }; otherwise
   * { valid: false };
   */
  async validate(request, session) {
    const user = await db.userStore.getUserById(session.id);
    if (!user) {
      return { isValid: false };
    }
    return { isValid: true, credentials: user };
  },
```

## Sign up page

![alt text](image-7.png)

It is routed as per the below line of code in **web-routes.js**

```
 { method: "GET", path: "/signup", config: accountsController.showSignup },
```

and its view is rendered by the **accounts-controller.js**

```
   signup: {
    auth: false,
    /**
     * validate object specifying our validation schema
     * (UserSpec) + failAction method,
     * to be called if the validation fails.
     * 'errors: error.details' will enable the signup page to show the errors
     * .takeover() will avoid the redirection to accountController, as Joi will manage the error
     */
    validate: {
      payload: UserSpec,
      options: { abortEarly: false },
      failAction: function (request, h, error) {
        return h.view("signup-view", { title: "Sign up error", errors: error.details }).takeover().code(400);
      },
    },
    handler: async function (request, h) {
      const users = await db.userStore.getAllUsers();
      const user = request.payload;

      /**
       * The below lines of code will verify whether the email inputted by the user to sign up
       * is already in the user store or not.
       * If the email is taken, the user will get redirected to the taken-email.hbs page, and advised
       * to use a different email to sign up.
       */

      let { email } = request.payload;
      let exEmail = "";
      // eslint-disable-next-line prefer-const
      let existingEmail = [];
      // eslint-disable-next-line no-shadow
      users.forEach((user) => {
        exEmail = user.email;
        console.log("Existing email", exEmail);
        existingEmail.push(exEmail);
      });
      let existingEmailNow = "";
      for (let i = 0; i < existingEmail.length; i += 1) {
        existingEmailNow = existingEmail[i];
        if (existingEmail[i] === email) {
          email = existingEmailNow;
          console.log("existingEmailNow", existingEmailNow);
          return h.redirect("/taken-email");
        }
      }
      await db.userStore.addUser(user);
      return h.redirect("/");
    },
  }
```

Once a new user object is created, the 'validation()' function will check the Joi schemas 'UserSpec' data, and if it comes across any issues, the failAction method will be called in, and will redirect the page to the errors.

The user data will, then, be stored into one of the stores being used by the app administrator:

- user-mongo-store.js
- user-json-store.js
- user-mem-store.js

**Mongoose T3**

![alt text](image-8.png)

**json**

![alt text](image-9.png)

The way that we tie these database logics is via the **db.js**, which is basically a facade from which we can choose the database we want the app to use.

## Joi Schemas

The information the user will be inputting is defined in the Joi Schemas file **joi-schema.js**, which indicates 'string', 'number', 'date' fields with value ranges when needed. Ex.:

```
export const UserSpec = UserCredentialsSpec.keys({
  firstName: Joi.string().min(3).max(30).example("Homer").required(),
  lastName: Joi.string().min(3).max(30).example("Simpson").required(),
  userLat: Joi.number().max(100).example(40.41541290283203),
  userLong: Joi.number().max(100).example(-3.684231996536255),
  country: Joi.string().min(3).max(30).example("Portugal").required(),
  street: Joi.string().min(3).max(50).example("Rua das Flores, 4").required(),
  addressCode: Joi.string().min(3).max(15).example("T12Y2NE").required(),
  DOB: JoiExtended.date().raw().format().required(),
  phoneNumber: Joi.number().example(892356189).required(),
  createdTimeStamp: JoiExtended.date().default(() => new Date()),
}).label("UserDetails");
```

The same logic applies to the 'categories' and 'placemarks' data.

## Joi Error Reporting

Furthermore, the 'Joi Error Reporting' was introduced, as Joi can generate human readable errors. Therefore, **error.hbs** partial was created in which errors are looped through and a handlebar will enable errors to show on the UX:

```
{{#if errors}}
  <div class="box content">
    <p> There was a problem... </p>
    <ul>
      {{#each errors}}
        <li>{{message}}</li>
      {{/each}}
    </ul>
  </div>
{{/if}}

```

The error.hbs file is added as a handlebar to the main.hbd template to ensure that the 'Joi Error Reporting' method is active throughout the app.
Additionally, the errors are passed from Joi to the view on any 'controller' actions where it is relevant:

```
validate: {
      payload: UserSpec,
      failAction: function (request, h, error) {
        return h.view("signup-view", { title: "Sign up error", errors: error.details }).takeover().code(400);
      },
    },

```

'errors: error.details' will enable the signup page to show the errors, whereas .takeover() will avoid the redirection to accountController, as Joi will manage the error:

![alt text](image-27.png)

## Account page

This page is where the user can check their personal details, and, also, update them via a Bulma form, which will show in a pop-up:

![alt text](image-10.png)

![alt text](image-11.png)

The **accounts-controller.js** renders the page through the below 'showAccount' route:

```
 showAccount: {
    handler: async function (request, h) {
      const loggedInUser = request.auth.credentials;
      const categories = await db.categoryStore.getUserCategories(loggedInUser._id);
      const accCat0 = await somethingAnalytics.getAccountCategories0(categories);
      const accCatId0 = await somethingAnalytics.getAccountCategoriesId0(categories);
      const accCat1 = await somethingAnalytics.getAccountCategories1(categories);
      const accCatId1 = await somethingAnalytics.getAccountCategoriesId1(categories);
      const accCat2 = await somethingAnalytics.getAccountCategories2(categories);
      const accCatId2 = await somethingAnalytics.getAccountCategoriesId2(categories);
      const accCat3 = await somethingAnalytics.getAccountCategories3(categories);
      const accCatId3 = await somethingAnalytics.getAccountCategoriesId3(categories);
      const userDetails = await db.userStore.getUserById(loggedInUser._id);
      const viewData = {
        title: "Your Account details | PlaceMark",
        user: loggedInUser,
        firstName: userDetails.firstName,
        lastName: userDetails.lastName,
        userLat: userDetails.userLat,
        userLong: userDetails.userLong,
        country: userDetails.country,
        street: userDetails.street,
        addressCode: userDetails.addressCode,
        DOB: userDetails.DOB,
        phoneNumber: userDetails.phoneNumber,
        email: userDetails.email,
        password: userDetails.password,
        accCat0: accCat0,
        accCatId0: accCatId0,
        accCat1: accCat1,
        accCatId1: accCatId1,
        accCat2: accCat2,
        accCatId2: accCatId2,
        accCat3: accCat3,
        accCatId3: accCatId3,
        _id: userDetails._id,
        createdTimeStamp: userDetails.createdTimeStamp,
      };
      return h.view("account-view", viewData);
    },
  },
```

After requesting the authorized credentials, I retrieve the 'categories' of the 'loggedInUser' as well as their 'userDetails'. The userDetails const retrieves all added user data from the userStore, and, then, the const 'viewData' will itemize them in order to, then, be rendered on the account page via handlebars.

![alt text](image-36.png)

**user-details.hbs**

If the user wished to update their details, or even delete the account altogether, the below routes will make the above-mentioned actions possible:

```
deleteAccount: {
    handler: async function (request, h) {
      const loggedInUser = request.auth.credentials;
      const user = await db.userStore.getUserById(loggedInUser._id);
      await db.userStore.deleteUserById(user._id);
      request.cookieAuth.clear();
      return h.redirect("/");
    },
  },

  updateAccount: {
    validate: {
      payload: updatedUserSpec,
      options: { abortEarly: false },
      failAction: function (request, h, error) {
        return h.view("account-view", { title: "Update user details error", errors: error.details }).takeover().code(400);
      },
    },
    handler: async function (request, h) {
      const loggedInUser = request.auth.credentials;
      const user = await db.userStore.getUserById(loggedInUser._id);
      const newUserLat = Number(request.payload.userLat);
      const newUserLong = Number(request.payload.userLong);
      const newCountry = request.payload.country;
      const newStreet = request.payload.street;
      const newAddressCode = request.payload.addressCode;
      const newPhoneNumber = Number(request.payload.phoneNumber);
      const newEmail = request.payload.email;
      const newPassword = request.payload.password;
      const updatedUser = {
        userLat: newUserLat,
        userLong: newUserLong,
        country: newCountry,
        street: newStreet,
        addressCode: newAddressCode,
        phoneNumber: newPhoneNumber,
        email: newEmail,
        password: newPassword,
        _id: user._id,
      };
      await db.userStore.updateUser(user, updatedUser);
      return h.redirect("/account");
    },
  },
```

The updateUser() function from the userStore will enable the user details updates:

**user-mongo-store.js**

```
 async updateUser(user, updatedUser) {
    const userDoc = await User.findOne({ _id: user._id });
    console.log(userDoc);
    user._id = updatedUser._id;
    userDoc.userLat = updatedUser.userLat;
    userDoc.userLong = updatedUser.userLong;
    userDoc.country = updatedUser.country;
    userDoc.street = updatedUser.street;
    userDoc.addressCode = updatedUser.addressCode;
    userDoc.phoneNumber = updatedUser.phoneNumber;
    userDoc.email = updatedUser.email;
    userDoc.password = updatedUser.password;
    await userDoc.save();
  },
```

**user-json-store.js**

```
async updateUser(user, updatedUser) {
    console.log(updatedUser);
    user._id = updatedUser._id;
    user.userLat = updatedUser.userLat;
    user.userLong = updatedUser.userLong;
    user.country = updatedUser.country;
    user.street = updatedUser.street;
    user.addressCode = updatedUser.addressCode;
    user.phoneNumber = updatedUser.phoneNumber;
    user.email = updatedUser.email;
    user.password = updatedUser.password;
    await db.write();
    console.log(user);
    return user;
  },
```

**user-mem-store.js**

```
  async updateUser(user, updatedUser) {
    console.log(updatedUser);
    user._id = updatedUser._id;
    user.userLat = updatedUser.userLat;
    user.userLong = updatedUser.userLong;
    user.country = updatedUser.country;
    user.street = updatedUser.street;
    user.addressCode = updatedUser.addressCode;
    user.phoneNumber = updatedUser.phoneNumber;
    user.email = updatedUser.email;
    user.password = updatedUser.password;
    console.log(user);
    return user;
  },
```

It is worth spending a few lines on a few variables created and itemized in the 'viewData' variable:

```
const accCat0 = await somethingAnalytics.getAccountCategories0(categories);
const accCatId0 = await somethingAnalytics.getAccountCategoriesId0(categories);
const accCat1 = await somethingAnalytics.getAccountCategories1(categories);
const accCatId1 = await somethingAnalytics.getAccountCategoriesId1(categories);
const accCat2 = await somethingAnalytics.getAccountCategories2(categories);
const accCatId2 = await somethingAnalytics.getAccountCategoriesId2(categories);
const accCat3 = await somethingAnalytics.getAccountCategories3(categories);
const accCatId3 = await somethingAnalytics.getAccountCategoriesId3(categories);
```

Here, the objective is to retrieve the name of the categories as well as their ids since the partial **stats-account.hbs** embedded in the **account-view.hbs** will show the categories that the user added. In the example below, there is an extract of the functions created in the **something-analytics.js** util file to achieve just that:

```
 getAccountCategories0(categories) {
    let accCat = "";
    // eslint-disable-next-line prefer-const
    let accCats = [];
    // eslint-disable-next-line prefer-const
    let accCatsId = [];
    let accCatId = "";
    categories.forEach((category) => {
      accCat = category.title;
      accCatId = category._id;
      accCats.push(accCat);
      accCatsId.push(accCatId);
    });
    // eslint-disable-next-line prefer-const
    let accCat0 = accCats[0];
    return accCat0;
  },

  getAccountCategoriesId0(categories) {
    let accCat = "";
    // eslint-disable-next-line prefer-const
    let accCats = [];
    // eslint-disable-next-line prefer-const
    let accCatsId = [];
    let accCatId = "";
    categories.forEach((category) => {
      accCat = category.title;
      accCatId = category._id;
      accCats.push(accCat);
      accCatsId.push(accCatId);
    });
    // eslint-disable-next-line prefer-const
    let accCatId0 = accCatsId[0];
    return accCatId0;
  },
```

The 'categories' value is passed along the parameter 'categories' in the above function, and then through iteration, the category values are fetched to be shown in the account page. The category values are the 'title' of the category as well as its id which is needed to create the category URL and make the title clickable (see the **stats-account.hbs**):

```
 <section class = "content pl-4">
    <div class="columns">
      <div class="column">
        <p class="is-size-4 mb-2 "><a href="/category/{{accCatId0}}" class="has-text-grey-light">{{accCat0}}</a> </p>
        <p class="is-size-4 mb-2"><a href="/category/{{accCatId1}}" class="has-text-grey-light">{{accCat1}}</a> </p>
        <p class="is-size-4 mb-2 "><a href="/category/{{accCatId2}}" class="has-text-grey-light">{{accCat2}}</a> </p>
        <p class="is-size-4 mb-6"><a href="/category/{{accCatId3}}" class="has-text-grey-light">{{accCat3}}</a> </p>
        <p class="is-size-7">* If you have added any categories, they will get displayed in this box. </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>
```

![alt text](image-12.png)

The **joi-schemas.js** also contains the below line which produces a 'time stamp' of when the account was created:

```
createdTimeStamp: JoiExtended.date().default(() => new Date().toLocaleString("en-IE")),

```

This is the list of the HTML files created for the account page:

- account-view.hbs
- user-deatils.hbs
- stats-account.hbs

and this is the list of the routes in **web-routes.js** for the account page:

```
 { method: "GET", path: "/", config: accountsController.index },
  { method: "GET", path: "/signup", config: accountsController.showSignup },
  { method: "GET", path: "/login", config: accountsController.showLogin },
  { method: "GET", path: "/logout", config: accountsController.logout },
  { method: "POST", path: "/register", config: accountsController.signup },
  { method: "POST", path: "/authenticate", config: accountsController.login },
  { method: "GET", path: "/account", config: accountsController.showAccount },
  { method: "GET", path: "/account/deleteuser/{id}", config: accountsController.deleteAccount },
  { method: "GET", path: "/account/edituser/", config: accountsController.showAccount },
  { method: "POST", path: "/account/updateuser/", config: accountsController.updateAccount },
```

## Dahboard

As the user logs in, they will land to the dashboard view where they can select one of the 4 available categories (Restaurants, Museums, Parks, Beaches) from a dropdown menu in a form. Once the category is selected, 'notes' will show what the category is used for, and an image representative of the category will display on the right column.

![alt text](image-38.png)

The first thing to notice is that the user won't be able to add the same category twice, which is a paramount feature since we don't want the user to get unnecessary duplicates. For this purpose, a few lines of code have been injected into the 'addCategory' route aiming at checking that the category just added by the user is not already stored in the 'categoryStore' :

```
addCategory: {
    validate: {
      payload: CategorySpec,

      failAction: function (request, h, error) {
        return h.view("dashboard-view", { title: "Category error", errors: error.details }).takeover().code(400);
      },
    },

    handler: async function (request, h) {
      const loggedInUser = request.auth.credentials;
      const categories = await db.categoryStore.getUserCategories(loggedInUser._id);
      // 'if' condition to determine image and 'notes to show according to the 'title' selected
      let image = "";
      let notes = "";
      // eslint-disable-next-line prefer-destructuring
      let title = request.payload.title;
      if (title === "Restaurants") {
        image = "https://i.ibb.co/gZjF0ppp/jerk-pasta-recipe.png";
        notes = "All restaurants you would like to dine or you already had the pleasure to be in can be added and listed here. Just a handy note for your next trip.";
      } else if (title === "Museums") {
        image = "https://i.ibb.co/HD39FR6p/man-2590655-big.jpg";
        notes = "This is the category in which all worldwide famous museums or art galleries you wish to visit or you lready visited can be added to.";
      } else if (title === "Beaches") {
        image = "https://i.ibb.co/LhrJWjcb/coast-7366616.jpg";
        notes = "There are surely so many beaches you would like to sunbath in and relish the sweet marine breeze caressing your skin. Why not list them all here?";
      } else {
        image = "https://i.ibb.co/pjbvydw1/parks.jpg";
        notes = "Sometimes, there is no better thing to do than slipping in your running shoes for a jog in the park. Which park are gonna go next though?";
      }
      const newCategory = {
        userid: loggedInUser._id,
        title: title,
        notes: notes,
        image: image,
      };

      /** Checking on whether the category title already exists. This app will only allow the user to add
       * 4 categories in its 'basic' version.
       */

      let exTitle = "";
      // eslint-disable-next-line prefer-const
      let existingTitle = [];
      categories.forEach((category) => {
        exTitle = category.title;
        console.log("Existing title", exTitle);
        existingTitle.push(exTitle);
      });
      let existingTitleNow = "";
      for (let i = 0; i < existingTitle.length; i += 1) {
        existingTitleNow = existingTitle[i];
        if (existingTitle[i] === title) {
          title = null;
          return h.redirect("/dashboard");
        }
      }
      await db.categoryStore.addCategory(newCategory);
      return h.redirect("/dashboard");
    },
  },

```

In a nutshell, we first iterate through the categories to retrieve the category data ('title' in our case) and we push it to a list we named 'existingTitle'. We, then, iterate through this list to check whether we find the title just inputted by the user. If there is one already, the title gets assigned a 'null' value and it won't be added to the dashboard.

Additionally, the list of categories will always be sorted by alphabetic order in the dashboard, as per the below function fom the **something-analytics.js** file:

```
// This method is used to sort categories by alphabetical order https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTHhlx25X-U
  getSortedCategories(categories) {
    const sortedCategories = categories.sort((a, b) => a.title.localeCompare(b.title));
    return sortedCategories;
  },

```

The below lines show the CategorySpec const in the **joi-schemas.js** file

```
export const CategorySpec = Joi.object()
  .keys({
    title: Joi.string().example("Museums").required(),
    userid: IdSpec,
    notes: Joi.string().min(20).max(1000).example("Here I will be adding all restaurants I would like to try out..."),
    image: Joi.string(),
    placemarks: PlacemarkArraySpec,
  })
  .label("Category");

export const CategorySpecPlus = CategorySpec.keys({
  _id: IdSpec,
  __v: Joi.number(),
}).label("CategoryPlus");

export const CategoryArraySpec = Joi.array().items(CategorySpecPlus).label("CategoryArray");

```

A category can also be deleted if needed.

Once the user is ready, they can click on the 'folder' icon and start adding placemarks.

The dashboard view is routed via the below lines in **web-routes.js**:

```
{ method: "GET", path: "/dashboard", config: dashboardController.index },
{ method: "POST", path: "/dashboard/addcategory", config: dashboardController.addCategory },
{ method: "GET", path: "/dashboard/deletecategory/{id}", config: dashboardController.deleteCategory },

```

## Category page

The Category view is the page where the user lands on when clicking on the 'folder' icon at the botttom of a category in the dahboard page:

![alt text](image-39.png)

On top of the page, the user will see a banner whose background color and image are customized according to the type of category. Ex.:

![alt text](image-14.png)

This particular feature has been achieved via 2 functions set up in the **category-analytics.js** file:

```
 getImageCode(category) {
    if (category) {
      let imageCode = null;
      for (let i = 0; i < 1; i += 1) {
        if (category.title === "Restaurants") {
          imageCode = "https://i.ibb.co/qL14ZG2g/mossel-dish-7724006-1280.jpg";
        } else if (category.title === "Museums") {
          imageCode = "https://i.ibb.co/C5hpYTW3/man-2590655-1280.jpg";
        } else if (category.title === "Beaches") {
          imageCode = "https://i.ibb.co/1YHM8FHt/coast-7366616-1280.jpg";
        } else if (category.title === "Parks") {
          imageCode = "https://i.ibb.co/jPnk3WxG/autumn-3731094-1280.jpg";
        }
      }
      return imageCode;
    }
    return null;
  },

  getBackgroundColor(category) {
    if (category) {
      let backgroundColor = "";
      for (let i = 0; i < 1; i += 1) {
        if (category.title === "Restaurants") {
          backgroundColor = "title box has-text-centered has-background-grey-dark has-text-white";
        } else if (category.title === "Museums") {
          backgroundColor = "title box has-text-centered has-background-black-bis has-text-white";
        } else if (category.title === "Beaches") {
          backgroundColor = "title box has-text-centered has-background-grey-light has-text-white";
        } else if (category.title === "Parks") {
          backgroundColor = "title box has-text-centered has-background-grey-darker has-text-white";
        }
      }
      return backgroundColor;
    }
    return null;
  },

```

The 'getImageCode(category)' function will set the image into the banner based upon the category title selected by the user (namely Restaurants, Beaches, Museums, Beaches). The images are all stored in the ImgBB free image hosting site [https://imgbb.com/](https://imgbb.com/).

The background color of the banner is set by the the 'getBackgroundColor(category)' function.

The 'index' route in the **category-controller.js** will handle the view of the category page, and it is in there that the 'imageCode', and 'backgroundColor' are retrieved from the **category-analytics.js** to, then, be shown on the category page:

```
index: {
    handler: async function (request, h) {
      const category = await db.categoryStore.getCategoryById(request.params.id);
      const imageCode = categoryAnalytics.getImageCode(category);
      const backgroundColor = categoryAnalytics.getBackgroundColor(category);
      ...

```

Moving down to the bottom of the page, above the footer, the user will be presented with a form to fill out in order to start adding up their placemarks. As soon as the user submits the placemark details, the action property in the form will 'post' them:

```
<form class="box" action="/category/{{category._id}}/addplacemark" method="POST">

```

The 'addPlacemark' route in the **category-controller.js** will handle the placemark creation and addition. The payload will be made of the 'PlacemarkSpec' data retrieved from the **joi-schemas.js** file:

```
export const PlacemarkSpec = Joi.object()
  .keys({
    title: Joi.string().min(3).max(30).example("El Parque del Buen Retiro").required(),
    lat: Joi.number().max(100).example(40.41541290283203).required(),
    long: Joi.number().max(100).example(-3.684231996536255).required(),
    address: Joi.string().min(3).max(150).example("Plaza de la Independencia, 728001").required(),
    country: Joi.string().min(3).max(30).example("Spain").required(),
    phone: Joi.number().example(89672435).required(),
    website: Joi.string().example("https://bit.ly/3bGwJUlrequired").required(),
    visited: Joi.string().min(2).max(3).example("Yes").required(),
    description: Joi.string()
      .min(100)
      .max(250)
      .example(
        "Covering over 125 hectares and comprising more than 15,000 trees, El Retiro Park–recently named a UNESCO World Heritage Site–is a green oasis in the heart of the city. And more!!!"
      )
      .required(),
    categoryid: IdSpec,
  })
  .label("Placemark");

export const updatedPlacemarkSpec = {
  title: Joi.string().min(3).max(30).required(),
  lat: Joi.number().max(100).required(),
  long: Joi.number().max(100).required(),
  address: Joi.string().min(3).max(150).required(),
  country: Joi.string().min(3).max(30).required(),
  phone: Joi.number().required(),
  website: Joi.string().required(),
  visited: Joi.string().min(2).max(3).required(),
  description: Joi.string().min(100).max(250),
};

export const PlacemarkSpecPlus = PlacemarkSpec.keys({
  _id: IdSpec,
  __v: Joi.number(),
}).label("PlacemarkPlus");

export const PlacemarkArraySpec = Joi.array().items(PlacemarkSpecPlus).label("PlacemarkArray");

```

We, then, retrieve the 'id' of the category where the placemark is being added, and request the payload of each placemark field the user added via the form:

```
  addPlacemark: {
    validate: {
      payload: PlacemarkSpec,
      options: { abortEarly: false },
      failAction: function (request, h, error) {
        return h.view("category-view", { title: "Add placemark error", errors: error.details }).takeover().code(400);
      },
    },
    handler: async function (request, h) {
      // We are retrieving/extracting the category
      const category = await db.categoryStore.getCategoryById(request.params.id);
      const newPlacemark = {
        /** The inputted data from the form will get here (payload),
         * and we stick them to a placemark object, and
         * finally we add the placemark to the database (placemarkStore) via the category
         * with its specific 'id' */
        title: request.payload.title,
        lat: Number(request.payload.lat),
        long: Number(request.payload.long),
        address: request.payload.address,
        country: request.payload.country,
        phone: Number(request.payload.phone),
        website: request.payload.website,
        visited: request.payload.visited,
        description: request.payload.description,
      };
      await db.placemarkStore.addPlacemark(category._id, newPlacemark);
      return h.redirect(`/category/${category._id}`);
    },
  },

```

The 'addPlacemark' function in the placemarkStore file will, at this point, take up the task of adding the newly created placemark to the store. Ex. **placemark-mongo-store.js** below:

```
async addPlacemark(categoryId, placemark) {
    try {
      placemark.categoryid = categoryId;
      const newplacemark = new Placemark(placemark);
      const placemarkObj = await newplacemark.save();
      return this.getPlacemarkById(placemarkObj._id);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error adding placemark:", error);
      throw error;
    }
  },

```

As the categoryId, and placemark are passed along as parameters, a new object 'newPlacemark' is created, and saved in the MongoDB store, and it will return a new placemark 'id'. The same type of logic will apply to the other placemarks stores (json and mem).

The **list-placemarks.hbs** is the the file that determines the layout of the placemarks, and it is made of a Bulma card. It also iterates the placemarks array via the '#each' helper in order to show all placemarks on the category page.

These are the routes to add and view placemarks:

```
{ method: "GET", path: "/category/{id}", config: categoryController.index },
  { method: "POST", path: "/category/{id}/addplacemark", config: categoryController.addPlacemark },

```

Right down into the footer of the placemark card, two icons will enable the user to update or delete the placemark:

![alt text](image-15.png)

```
<footer class="card-footer">
    <a href="/category/{{../category._id}}/editplacemark/{{_id}}" class="button card-footer-item">
    <span class="icon is-small">
    <i class="fas fa-solid fa-edit"></i>
    </span>
    </a>
    <a href="/category/{{../category._id}}/deleteplacemark/{{_id}}" class="button card-footer-item">
    <span class="icon is-small">
    <i class="fas fa-solid fa-trash"></i>
    </span>
    </a>
  </footer>

```

The updatePlacemark route is in the **placemark-controller.js** file, and gets evoked by the form action in **edit-placemark.hbs** :

```
<form class="box" action="/category/{{category._id}}/updateplacemark/{{placemark._id}}" method="POST">

```

Therefore, upon clicking on the placemark update icon, the user lands on a new route/page inside the placemark itself:

```
  { method: "GET", path: "/category/{categoryid}/editplacemark/{placemarkid}", config: placemarkController.index },
  { method: "POST", path: "/category/{categoryid}/updateplacemark/{placemarkid}", config: placemarkController.updatePlacemark },
```

It will, then, be redirected back to the category page once the updates are submitted:

```
from the placemark-controller.jd file
....

updatePlacemark: {
    validate: {
      payload: updatedPlacemarkSpec,
      options: { abortEarly: false },
      failAction: function (request, h, error) {
        return h.view("placemark-view", { title: "Update placemark details error", errors: error.details }).takeover().code(400);
      },
    },
    handler: async function (request, h) {
      const categoryId = request.params.categoryid;
      const category = await db.categoryStore.getCategoryById(categoryId);
      const placemarkId = request.params.placemarkid;
      const placemark = await db.placemarkStore.getPlacemarkById(placemarkId);
      const updatedTitle = request.payload.title;
      const updatedLat = request.payload.lat;
      const updatedLong = request.payload.long;
      const updatedAddress = request.payload.address;
      const updatedCountry = request.payload.country;
      const updatedPhone = request.payload.phone;
      const updatedWebsite = request.payload.website;
      const updatedVisited = request.payload.visited;
      const updatedDescription = request.payload.description;
      const updatedPlacemark = {
        title: updatedTitle,
        lat: updatedLat,
        long: updatedLong,
        address: updatedAddress,
        country: updatedCountry,
        phone: updatedPhone,
        website: updatedWebsite,
        visited: updatedVisited,
        description: updatedDescription,
        _id: placemark._id,
      };
      await db.placemarkStore.updatePlacemark(placemark, updatedPlacemark);
      return h.redirect(`/category/${categoryId}`);
    },
  },

```

Another feature added to the category page is the one that lets the user add an image to the category page. Its widget, generated by the partial **category-image.hbs** is positioned right below the form used to add placemarks:

![alt text](image-16.png)

However, the Bulma upload file component in [https://bulma.io/documentation/form/file/](https://bulma.io/documentation/form/file/) provides a script which shows an empty image before an image gets uploaded. I found it not as a great user experience, and consulted ChatGPT [https://chatgpt.com/](https://chatgpt.com/) to enhance the script to the extent that now the image card no longer shows the empty image icon when no image is uploaded.

```
<script>
  /** If you want to prevent displaying the placeholder image when no image is uploaded,
  and ensure that it only shows once an image is selected or already uploaded, here’s a
  new approach: Steps to Implement
  Hide the image element completely if no image exists.
  Only show the image once it's uploaded or if it already exists.
  We'll conditionally render the image using server-side logic (e.g., using a templating engine)
  and then hide it or show a preview based on whether a file is selected.*/

  /** Solution
  We will start by hiding the image element by default and show it once there is an actual image
  to display. You can do this using JavaScript to dynamically check for an image and toggle
  its visibility. */

    const fileInput = document.querySelector(".file-input");
    const categoryImage = document.getElementById("category-image");
    const fileNameDisplay = document.querySelector(".file-name");

    // Display image if it already exists when page loads
    if (categoryImage.src && categoryImage.src !== "") {
      categoryImage.style.display = "block";  // Show the image if it has a valid src
    }

    fileInput.onchange = () => {
      if (fileInput.files.length > 0) {
        const fileName = fileInput.files[0].name;
        fileNameDisplay.textContent = fileName;

        // Show the image preview immediately after selection
        const reader = new FileReader();
        reader.onload = () => {
          categoryImage.src = reader.result; // Set the image source to the file
          categoryImage.style.display = 'block';  // Show the image
        };
        reader.readAsDataURL(fileInput.files[0]); // Read the selected file as a Data URL
      }
    };
</script>

```

![alt text](image-17.png)
No image.

![alt text](image-18.png)

Image uploaded.

The uploadImage and deleteImage handlers are in the **category-controller.js** file:

```
uploadImage: {
    handler: async function (request, h) {
      try {
        const category = await db.categoryStore.getCategoryById(request.params.id);
        const file = request.payload.imagefile;
        if (Object.keys(file).length > 0) {
          const url = await imageStore.uploadImage(request.payload.imagefile);
          category.img = url;
          await db.categoryStore.updateCategory(category);
        }
        return h.redirect(`/category/${category._id}`);
      } catch (err) {
        console.log(err);
        return h.redirect("/");
      }
    },
    payload: {
      multipart: true,
      output: "data",
      maxBytes: 209715200,
      parse: true,
    },
  },

  deleteImage: {
    handler: async function (request, h) {
      try {
        const category = await db.categoryStore.getCategoryById(request.params.id);
        if (category.img) {
          await imageStore.deleteImage(category.img);
          category.img = null;
          await db.categoryStore.updateCategory(category);
        }
        return h.redirect(`/category/${category._id}`);
      } catch (err) {
        console.log("Error during image deletion:", err);
        return h.redirect(`/category/${category._id}`); // Redirect even in case of error
      }
    },
  },
```

The functions updateImage() and deleteImage() are called in from the **image-store.js** file from which the images will be uploaded or deleted into the [Cloudinary](https://console.cloudinary.com/) account of the app administrator.

These are the routes used to upload or delete an image in the category page:

```
  { method: "POST", path: "/category/{id}/uploadimage", config: categoryController.uploadImage },
  { method: "GET", path: "/category/{id}/deleteimage", config: categoryController.deleteImage },

```

As **category.js** file also shows a field for the image 'img',

```
  const categorySchema = new Schema({
  title: String,
  notes: String,
  img: String,
  image: String,
  userid: {
    type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: "User",
  },
});

```

once an image has been added, the updateCategory function in **category-mongo-store.js** will ensure that the img field will pop up in the categoryStore:

```
async updateCategory(updatedCategory) {
    const category = await Category.findOne({ _id: updatedCategory._id });
    category.title = updatedCategory.title;
    category.img = updatedCategory.img;
    await category.save();
  },
```

### Category page Analytics

This section is a 4 column box with some analytics of the placemarks in the category.

![alt text](image-37.png)

The user will have a simple report with the total number of placemarks added, the number of those already visited, those yet to be visited, the distance measured in km of the furthest placemark as well as that of the nearest one, and finally, a count of those that are 'local' versus those that are situated abroad.

It is worth spending a few lines now on the functions created to achieve the placemarks analytics report, which are listed into the **category-analytics.js** and into the **category-controller.js** files.

```

countPlacemarks(category) {
    if (category.placemarks) {
      let placemarkSum = 0;
      for (let i = 0; i < category.placemarks.length; i += 1) {
        placemarkSum += 1;
      }
      return placemarkSum;
    }
  },

```

The countPlacemarks() is a basic one to count the total number of placemarks in the category by simply iterating through the placemarks length and adding 1 for each of them to the variable 'placemarkSum'.

```

 // eslint-disable-next-line consistent-return
  getYesCounting(category) {
    if (category.placemarks) {
      const yes = [];
      const no = [];
      let visit = "";
      let yesNoIcon = "";
      // Loop through all placemarks in the category
      for (let i = 0; i < category.placemarks.length; i += 1) {
        visit = category.placemarks[i].visited;
        if (visit === "No") {
          yesNoIcon = "no";
          no.push(yesNoIcon);
        } else if (visit === "Yes") {
          yesNoIcon = "yes";
          yes.push(yesNoIcon);
        } else {
          yesNoIcon = null;
        }
      }
      const yesCounting = yes.length;
      return yesCounting;
    }
  },

  // eslint-disable-next-line consistent-return
  getNoCounting(category) {
    if (category.placemarks) {
      const yes = [];
      const no = [];
      let visit = "";
      let yesNoIcon = "";
      // Loop through all placemarks in the category
      for (let i = 0; i < category.placemarks.length; i += 1) {
        visit = category.placemarks[i].visited;
        if (visit === "No") {
          yesNoIcon = "no";
          no.push(yesNoIcon);
        } else if (visit === "Yes") {
          yesNoIcon = "yes";
          yes.push(yesNoIcon);
        } else {
          yesNoIcon = null;
        }
      }
      const noCounting = no.length;
      return noCounting;
    }
  },

```

getYesCounting() and getNoCounting() functions will count the placemarks that have already been visited versus those that have yet to be. In a nutshell, the logic followed here is create a couple of lists, one for 'yes' and one for 'no', then iterate through all placemarks, and assign values to the variable 'visit'. If 'visit' gets assigned the value 'no', then, this value is 'pushed' to the 'no' list and viceversa. In the end, the 'no' or 'yes' lists will be counted by appending 'length' and, then, will be 'returned'.

The below function instead will calculate the 'furthest' and 'closest' placemarks, and it is embedded into the 'index' route in the **category-controller.js**:

```

          a = Math.sin(dLat / 2) * Math.sin(dLat / 2) + Math.cos(toRadians(lat1)) * Math.cos(toRadians(lat2)) * Math.sin(dLong / 2) * Math.sin(dLong / 2);
          c = 2 * Math.atan2(Math.sqrt(a), Math.sqrt(1 - a));
          distance = R * c;
          allDistances.push(distance);

      if (resultMax === -Infinity) {
        resultMax = 0;
      } else {
        const maxRounded = resultMax.toFixed(2);
        resultMax = `${maxRounded} km away`;
      }

      let resultMin = Math.min(...allDistances);
      console.log("MinDist", allDistances);
      if (resultMin === Infinity) {
        resultMin = 0;
      } else {
        const minRounded = resultMin.toFixed(2);
        resultMin = `${minRounded} km away`;
      }

```

This section was built on the following source [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18883601/function-to-calculate-distance-between-two-coordinates](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18883601/function-to-calculate-distance-between-two-coordinates), and adjusted to fit for the PlaceMark app purposes. We are basically retrieving the userLat and userLong variable values from the user account. Then, there is an iteration through the placemarks, and a range of calculations will enable us to achieve the 'distance' value, which will, in turn, get pushed to a list called minDistance or maxDistance, based upon which function we are in. At this point, the 'Math.min()' or 'Math.max()' functions will pull the min or max distance, which will ultimately get returned.

The below function will count the number of local, abroad placemarks, and assign icons :

```
  /* --- Setting variables for counting abroad and local counts and icons ----*/

      let localTravelIcon = "";
      let abroadTravelIcon = "";
      // eslint-disable-next-line prefer-const
      let local = [];
      // eslint-disable-next-line prefer-const
      let abroad = [];
      let localCounting = "";
      let abroadCounting = "";
      let localIcon = "";
      let abroadIcon = "";
      let destination = "";
      // Loop through all placemarks in the category
      for (let i = 0; i < category.placemarks.length; i += 1) {
        destination = category.placemarks[i].country;
        destination = destination.toLowerCase().trim();
        // eslint-disable-next-line prefer-const
        let userCountry = userDetails.country.toLowerCase().trim();
        if (destination === userCountry) {
          // eslint-disable-next-line quotes
          localIcon = "https://i.ibb.co/Q7J1t5jt/102-lokasimanusia-mini.jpg";
          localCounting = "Yes";
          local.push(localCounting);
          localTravelIcon = "fas fa-solid fa-car";
        } else {
          abroadIcon = "https://i.ibb.co/mVhwZKmD/international-mini-1.png";
          abroadCounting = "No";
          abroad.push(abroadCounting);
          abroadTravelIcon = "fas fa-solid fa-plane";
        }
      }
      localCounting = local.length;
      abroadCounting = abroad.length;

```

All of these functions follow the same logic as previously set out, essentially. Below is the whole 'index' route in the **category-controller.js** file

```
index: {
    handler: async function (request, h) {
      const loggedInUser = request.auth.credentials;

      const imageCode = categoryAnalytics.getImageCode(category);
      const backgroundColor = categoryAnalytics.getBackgroundColor(category);
      const placemarkSum = categoryAnalytics.countPlacemarks(category);
      const yesCounting = categoryAnalytics.getYesCounting(category);
      const noCounting = categoryAnalytics.getNoCounting(category);

      /* --- Setting variables for counting abroad and local counts and icons ----*/

      let localTravelIcon = "";
      let abroadTravelIcon = "";
      // eslint-disable-next-line prefer-const
      let local = [];
      // eslint-disable-next-line prefer-const
      let abroad = [];
      let localCounting = "";
      let abroadCounting = "";
      let localIcon = "";
      let abroadIcon = "";
      let destination = "";
      // Loop through all placemarks in the category
      for (let i = 0; i < category.placemarks.length; i += 1) {
        destination = category.placemarks[i].country;
        destination = destination.toLowerCase().trim();
        // eslint-disable-next-line prefer-const
        let userCountry = userDetails.country.toLowerCase().trim();
        if (destination === userCountry) {

          localCounting = "Yes";
          local.push(localCounting);
          localTravelIcon = "fas fa-solid fa-car";
        } else {
          abroadIcon = "https://i.ibb.co/mVhwZKmD/international-mini-1.png";

### Bugs and defects

The method above used to calculate the distance is not always perfectly accurate, and may be sligthly off, as far as I can see by crossing the given results with what the search engines usually return for the same queries. However, I also did try other methods, and all of them return the same distances as the above method.

## Placemark page

The purpose of this landing page is just to provide some more info about the placemark selected. A user will land to this page after clicking on a placemark title on the category-view page.

![alt text](image-21.png)

Handlebars in the **placemark.hbs** file will help us convey some of the information already shown on the category placemark card:

```
 <p class="title has-text-centered is-2 pt-4 pb-2">
              #instaPlaceMark {{titleShort}}!
            </p>
            <p class="subtitle has-text-centered mb-6">
              InstaMark your instaPlaces
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <main class="columns box">
        <section class="column is-8 m-2">
          <h4>{{titleShort}}, {{country}}</h4>
          <p>
            {{description}} Find out more on <a href="{{website}}" target="_blank" class="has-text-grey">{{website}}</a>.
          </p>
          <p>Hey! To get to {{titleShort}}, you need to travel by {{travelMeans}}, and it is {{distance}}.</p>
          <p>{{youShouldVisit}}{{titleShort}}!</p>
          <div class="buttons pt-3">
            <a href="{{website}}" target="_blank" class="has-text-grey">
            <button class="button is-info has-text-white">Find out more</button>
            </a>
          </div>
        </section>
        <section class="column is-4 ">

        </section>
      </main>
      <section class="section">
        <div class="container">
          <h5 class="has-text-centered">@{{titleShort}}</h5>


```

However, there is also an attempt to enrich the user experience by providing some additional information using some functions in the **category-analytics.js** and **placemarks-controller.js** file:

```
 /* --- This section will determine the means of transport to show based upon the user's location --- */
      let travelMeans = "";
      let destination = "";
      if (placemark) {
        destination = placemark.country;
        destination = destination.toLowerCase().trim();
        // eslint-disable-next-line prefer-const
        let userCountry = userDetails.country.toLowerCase().trim();
        if (destination === userCountry) {
          travelMeans = "car, bus, or train";
        } else {
          travelMeans = "plane";
        }
      }
```

placemark-controller.js

```

// eslint-disable-next-line consistent-return
getYouShouldVisit(placemark) {
  let youShouldVisit = "";
  let visit = "";
  if (placemark) {
    visit = placemark.visited;
    if (visit === "No") {
      youShouldVisit = "What are you waiting for? Time to pay a visit to ";
    } else {
      youShouldVisit = "Although you have already been there, it is never a bad idea to visit again the ";
    }
  }
  return youShouldVisit;
},
```

category-analytics.js

![alt text](image-22.png)

As one can see above, this banner content will suggest the travel means the user might need to travel to the destination based upon whether they are located in the user's country or abroad. While traveling to a destination within the user's country borders can be done by bus, car or train, if the destination is abroad, the user gets the advice of getting on a plane. Also, if the destination has not been visited yet, a sentence at the bottom will encourage the user to go.

Particularly interesting is the feature that enables us to get the distance between the user's and the destination location, whose code is embedded in the 'placemark' handler into the **placemark-controller.js** file:

```
 placemark: {
    handler: async function (request, h) {
      const categoryId = request.params.id;
      const placemarkId = request.params.placemarkid;
      const category = await db.categoryStore.getCategoryById(categoryId);
      const placemark = await db.placemarkStore.getPlacemarkById(placemarkId);
      const travelMeans = categoryAnalytics.getTravelMeans(placemark);
      const youShouldVisit = categoryAnalytics.getYouShouldVisit(placemark);

      /* --------- The below section calculates the distance between the user's and the placemark location ----- */
      const lat1 = category.userLat;
      const long1 = category.userLong;
      const toRadians = (degrees) => degrees * (Math.PI / 180);
      const R = 6371; // Radius of the Earth in
      // eslint-disable-next-line prefer-const
      let long2 = 0;
      // eslint-disable-next-line prefer-const
      let lat2 = 0;
      let a = 0;
      let c = 0;
      let dLat = 0;
      let dLong = 0;
      let title = "";
      let country = "";
      // eslint-disable-next-line prefer-const, no-new-object
      let distance = 0;
      if (category.placemarks) {
        for (let i = 0; i < category.placemarks.length; i += 1) {
          long2 = placemark.long;
          lat2 = placemark.lat;
          title = placemark.title;
          country = placemark.country;
          dLat = toRadians(lat2 - lat1);
          dLong = toRadians(long2 - long1);
          // eslint-disable-next-line no-const-assign
          a = Math.sin(dLat / 2) * Math.sin(dLat / 2) + Math.cos(toRadians(lat1)) * Math.cos(toRadians(lat2)) * Math.sin(dLong / 2) * Math.sin(dLong / 2);
          c = 2 * Math.atan2(Math.sqrt(a), Math.sqrt(1 - a));
          distance = R * c;
        }
      }
      // https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3163070/javascript-displaying-a-float-to-2-decimal-places
      distance = Number(distance).toFixed(2);
      if (distance === -Infinity) {
        distance = 0;
      } else {
        distance = `${distance} km away`;
      }
      /* ----------------------------------------------------  */

      const viewData = {
        title: ` ${placemark.title} | #instaPlaceMark!`,
        titleShort: placemark.title,
        lat: placemark.lat,
        long: placemark.long,
        address: placemark.address,
        country: placemark.country,
        website: placemark.website,
        description: placemark.description,
        categoryId: categoryId,
        placemarkId: placemarkId,
        travelMeans: travelMeans,
        youShouldVisit: youShouldVisit,
        distance: distance,
      };
      return h.view("placemark", viewData);
    },
  },

```

As far as the images shown in the banner and grid, they are just placeholders since the intention here is to further develop this section for the next assignment, and, maybe, have images dynamically showing up for each placemark.

The weather widget on top of the page is noteworthy too. The idea would be that the user might want to take a quick peek of the current weather conditions in the destination they aim to visit:

![alt text](image-24.png)

This is a widget I am bringing in from the SETU Computer Systems and Network module final assignment in https://instapi.glitch.me/, and it is based on JavaScript Fetch API. To get the weather widget up and running, I educated myself through this guide https://medium.com/@ravipatel.it/a-comprehensive-guide-to-fetching-weather-data-using-javascript-fetch-api-13133d0bc2e6, and adjusted the code to serve the purposes of the PlaceMark app:

```
 <script>
    // https://medium.com/@ravipatel.it/a-comprehensive-guide-to-fetching-weather-data-using-javascript-fetch-api-13133d0bc2e6

    const API_KEY = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx';
    const BASE_URL = 'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/';


    async function getWeather() {
      const city = document.getElementById('cityInput').value;
      if (!city) {
        alert('Please enter a city name.');
        return;
      }

      try {
        // Fetch current weather
        const weatherResponse = await fetch(`${BASE_URL}weather?q=${city}&appid=${API_KEY}&units=metric&units`);
        const weatherData = await weatherResponse.json();
        displayCurrentWeather(weatherData);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
        alert('Failed to fetch weather data.');
      }
    }
      function displayCurrentWeather(data) {
        const weatherBody = document.getElementById('weatherBody');
        weatherBody.innerHTML = `

           <div class="column has-text-centered is-4">
             <p class="has-text-weight-bold"> City </p>
             <p>${data.name}</p>
           </div>
           <div class="column has-text-centered is-4">
             <p class="has-text-weight-bold"> Temperature </p>
             <p>${data.main.temp}°C</p>
           </div>
           <div class="column has-text-centered is-4">
             <p class="has-text-weight-bold"> Condition </p>
             <p>${data.weather[0].description}</p>
           </div>
        `;
      }

      function displayForecast(data) {
        const forecastBody = document.getElementById('forecastBody');
        forecastBody.innerHTML = '';

        // Forecast data comes in 3-hour intervals, so we'll filter to get daily forecasts
        const dailyForecasts = data.list.filter(item => item.dt_txt.includes('12:00:00'));
        dailyForecasts.forEach(forecast => {
          const date = new Date(forecast.dt_txt).toLocaleDateString();
        });
      }
  </script>

```

The widget may be further developed for the next assignment.

Finally, this is the route that enables the placemark page to show:

```
 { method: "GET", path: "/category/{id}/placemark/{placemarkid}", config: placemarkController.placemark },

## TDD (Test-driven development)

This app development has been guided by the TDD principles, hence, any feature development has been tested, and, where needed, the code has been refactored.

The strategy used was that of, first of all, using two supporting components to allow us to run unit tests:

- https://mochajs.org/
- https://www.chaijs.com/

We created a 'test/model' folder hierarchy in which we have added the below testing files:

- **category-model-test.js**
- **placemark-model-test.js**
- **user-model-test.js**

To feed the app with testing data, the **fixture.js** file was created with dummy content for users, categories, and placemarks.

At this point, whenever the command `npm run test` is run on the terminal to test via 'Chai', a report of the tests will be delivered:

![alt text](image-25.png)

4 tests are failing because of the fact that the app is not running at the moment.

If the Mocha Test Explorer plugin is installed, and the tests are run via the lab icon on VsCode, then all tests should pass (I am using the 'Mongo DB' database):

### MongoDB, Robo 3T, Mongoose

To connect MongoDb (https://www.mongodb.org) database service to the PlaceMark app, we are using the Robo 3T app https://robomongo.org. At that point the Mongoose library has been installed `npm install mongoose`, and imported into the mongo models files :

- user.js
- user-mongo-store.js
- category.js
- category-mongo-store.js
- placemark.js
- placemark-mongo-store.js

The Mongo connection has, then, been defined in the '.env' file using the below strings (the first one, which is commented out, is created for the MongoDB connection, whereas the second connects Atlas (https://cloud.mongodb.com/)):

```
# db=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/placemark?directConnection=true

db=mongodb+srv://latinxxxxxxx:xxxxxxxxxx@cluster0.u8y0d.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0

```

Finally, the **connect.js** file was created to establish a connection to the database, and logging errors to the console.
The **db.js** is also updated to introduce an option to connect to mongo if selected.

### REST API

As we wanted to expose our app to APIs, we first installed the boom module `npm install @hapi/boom` to make it retiring HTTP code more convenient
(https://hapi.dev/module/boom). Then, in order to create the API for the PlaceMark app, the below modules were created:

- api-routes.js: a set of routes to service the api
- users-api.js: implementation of the User API
- category-api.js: implementation of the Category API
- placemark-api.js: implementation of the Placemark API

Next step was to create a set of API file tests in the 'test/api' folder:

- category-api-test.js
- placemark-api-test.js
- user-api-test.js
- placemark-service.js

Additionally, as we needed a HTTP Client Library, 'axios' was installed (https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) and imported into the **placemark-service.js** file, which is the encapsulation to access the api:

```
import axios from "axios";

import { serviceUrl } from "../fixtures.js";

export const placemarkService = {
  placemarkUrl: serviceUrl,

  async createUser(user) {
    const res = await axios.post(`${this.placemarkUrl}/api/users`, user);
    return res.data;
  },
...

```

As we are processing these API tests over HTTP, they require that the application be running (`npm run start`).

However, to make the development experience a little more convenient, 'Nodemon' (https://github.com/remy/nodemon) was used to avoid having to restart the server every time a change made was to its implementation.

### OpenAPI

To document the API, the route chosen was that of following a widely accepted standard:

- https://www.openapis.org/

However, the tool used is Swagger (https://swagger.io/), which is an OpenAPI specification.

In order, then, to create the metadata to document our API to support Swagger/OpenAPI standards, the hapi-swagger plugin https://github.com/glennjones/hapi-swagger was used.

At that point, the HAPI endpoints were annotated with all information needed, and, appropriate metadata conformant with Swagger/OpenAPI got generated.

To ensure this all works, the Vision and Inert plugins were installed too:

- https://hapi.dev/module/inert
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hapi/vision

Without going into further details, once the annotations were added to the **user-api.js**, **category-api.js**, and **placemrk-api.js** files (user-api.js example below of the 'create' action):

```
  create: {
    auth: false,
    handler: async function(request, h) {
      try {
        const user = await db.userStore.addUser(request.payload);
        if (user) {
          return h.response(user).code(201);
        }
        return Boom.badImplementation("error creating user");
      } catch (err) {
        return Boom.serverUnavailable("Database Error");
      }
    },
    tags: ["api"],
    description: "Create a User",
    notes: "Returns the newly created user",
    validate: { payload: UserSpec, failAction: validationError },
    response: { schema: UserSpec, failAction: validationError },
  },
```

the Swagger documentation would finally display for the user, category, and placemark endpoints, and would be available for testing on a local server (ex. http://localhost:3000/documentation):

### JSON Web Token (JWT)

The PlaceMark app also features a JSON Web Tokens (JWT), which provides a mechanism to authenticate users, validate identities, and secure a safe communication between clients, and servers, staving off any unathorized access.

To that end, the **jwt-utils.js** was created into the 'api' folder to make a set of utilities available for encoding, decoding and validating tokens, while the JWT system was initialized by importing and registering it into the **server.js**.

Additionally, the **api-routers.js** file had to be enriched with the following route:

```
  { method: "POST", path: "/api/users/authenticate", config: userApi.authenticate },
```

A new action was, then, created into the **user-api.js** file:

```
import { createToken } from "./jwt-utils.js";
...

  authenticate: {
    auth: false,
    handler: async function (request, h) {
      try {
        const user = await db.userStore.getUserByEmail(request.payload.email);
        if (!user) {
          return Boom.unauthorized("User not found");
        }
        if (user.password !== request.payload.password) {
          return Boom.unauthorized("Invalid password");
        }
        const token = createToken(user);
        return h.response({ success: true, token: token }).code(201);
      } catch (err) {
        return Boom.serverUnavailable("Database Error");
      }
    },
  },

```

Hence, as per the above code, if there is a matching user, a token gets created and returned.

The **placemark-service.js** was also extended to include the new methods to authenticate a user:

```
  async authenticate(user) {
    const response = await axios.post(`${this.playtimeUrl}/api/users/authenticate`, user);
    axios.defaults.headers.common["Authorization"] = "Bearer " + response.data.token;
    return response.data;
  },

  async clearAuth() {
    axios.defaults.headers.common["Authorization"] = "";
  }
```

These methods set the appropriate HTTP parameters to include accessing the endpoint with a valid user as well as the token header for all axios requests, until clearAuth() is called.

The **auth-api-test.js** was, then, created for the user testing.

Finally, the authorization strategy was changed in all **xxx-api.js** files for all routes, except for 'create', and 'authenticate' in the **user-api.js** file, otherwise there would be no endpoints for registration and authentication (Ex. 'find' action below):

```
 find: {
    auth: {
      strategy: "jwt",
    },
    handler: async function (request, h) {
      try {
        const users = await db.userStore.getAllUsers();
    ....
```

At this point, because almost all routes are secured due to the above authorization strategy, a change was needed into the **server.js** **swaggerOptions** const to add some additional parameters:

```
...
const swaggerOptions = {
  info: {
    title: "Placemark API",
    version: "0.1",
  },
  securityDefinitions: {
    jwt: {
      type: "apiKey",
      name: "Authorization",
      in: "header",
    },
  },
  security: [{ jwt: [] }],
};
...
```

which, ultimately, led up to an 'Authorize' button to appear on the Swagger Placemark documentation:

![alt text](image-29.png)

At this point, once a new user is created in our Swagger documentation http://localhost:3000/documentation#/api/postApiUsers,

![alt text](image-30.png)

we could then use the created token to authorize the rest of the Swagger tests:

![alt text](image-31.png)

The tests were, then, successful (Ex. below):

### Bug, defects

Unfortunately, the create category does show a 503 error, which I was unable to resolve:

## Mongo database on Cloud Atlas

The PlaceMark app has been connected to the Mongo database on Cloud Atlas, which is in sync with the Robo T3 database:

Ex.

![Alt](image-34.png)

**Robo T3** user 'Homer Simpson'

![alt text](image-35.png)

**Cloud Atlas** user 'Homer Simpson'

## Bugs and defects

The Json stores kept showing errors for the 'model' test, and due to time constraints, and lest I would compromise the MongoDB successful tests (Mongo is the primary base that this app uses), I resolved to no longer maintain the Json tests.

# Deployment

The app was deployed on https://dashboard.render.com/ and can be acceseed on https://placemark-v63d.onrender.com .

# Who maintains and contributes to the project

This project will be maintained by myself only.

# Acknowledgements

My lecture Eamonn de Leastar provided all knowledge I needed to build and set up the app through the Full Stack WebDevelopment 1 module and tools such as HTML, Bulma CSS framework, Javascript, node.js, Hapi, Express/Handlebars, lowdb database, and so on.

Special thanks to John Rellis too as he transferred plenty of the knowledge in the web development 2 needed for this project when working on the following assignment https://evanescent-mercury-naranja.glitch.me/ during summer 2024.

And a big thank you to my fellow students for asking questions on our Slack channel from which I was able to capture useful bits for the project.

Thank you all again!!!
